# MyfirstRepo
Getting started with GA DS5K:
In order to edit this file, I first typed 'git add filename.md'.
Then, I checked 'git status'.
In order to edit, I typed 'vi filename'.
I then typed 'i'.
I am now typing my text edits.
After, I will press the esc key and type ":wq" to save and exit.
Lastly, I will type 'git add' before 'git commit -m "message"'.
